    Target:

        Ideas for handling global and local spaces.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------


    Use VOSpace to crteate a hierarchy where there isn't one.

    VOSpace nodes may refer to data objects or collections in Rucio.
    VOSpace nodes may refer to in other storage services.

    VOSpace creates a hierarchical namespace that makes sense to the user.


    /srcnet/global/users/<username>/...

    /srcnet/global/projects/<projname>/...

    then local platform copies

    /srcnet/local/<platform>/users/<username>/...

    /srcnet/local/<platform>/projects/<projname>/...


    If user copies data from 'global' to 'platform',
    the system maintains a link back to the original
    in 'global'.

    If the local copy is changed, it is marked and changed.
    If the global copy is changed, the local copy is marked as stale.
    The user can elect to sync up to global or down to local.

    Parts of the local view may map to posix filesystems.
    Viewed in the posix filesystem they are just files.
    Viewed in VOSpace shows the links to upstream global files.

    Kind of like a tree view of a git repository,
    with metadata about the links to the clone origin.
