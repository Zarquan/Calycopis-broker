    Validation process uses Platform to get Factories and create Builders

        @autowired in constructor
        Platform platform

        SimpleStorageResourceValidator
            builder = new SimpleStorageResourceValidator.EntityBuilder()
                {
                build(session)
                    {
                    return platform.getStorageResourceEntityFactory().create(
                        session,
                        validated
                        );
                    }
                }

        platform.getSimpleStorageResourceEntityFactory()
        -> PodmanStorageResourceEntityFactory extends SimpleStorageResourceEntityFactory
        create(....)
        -> PodmanStorageResourceEntity extends SimpleStorageResourceEntity


# -----------------------------------------------------

    Creating a full set of entities for each platform is a lot of duplication.
    .. but it gives us somewhere to store platform specific data.
