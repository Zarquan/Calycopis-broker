Execution Broker review

The Execution Broker project has evolved into several components covering
multiple streams within SRCNet, not only Execution Broker itself, but
part of the work also applies to Workstep Execution, Workstep
Editing, Software Discovery, Science Portal, data provenance, and user
history.
It is past the point where a single person can handle all of the different
roles involved with all of these components.
The goal of this feature is to bring another person on board to share the
knowledge about the project and help handle some of the tasks.

The feature deliverable would be to produce a review of the project,
including a technical analysis of the work done so
far, and an assesment of the potential benefits, problems and issues
going forward.


The work would probably take around two weeks for two people
(the reviewer and the reviewee) spread
over two months. It would consist of a series of meetings with time in
between to write the documentation needed to transfer the knowledge.

The aim is for SRCNet to haveat least one other person who understands all
the different aspects of the project. Increasing the bus number to more
than one.

If successful, the new person would be able to advise on how to proceed
with further development and provide a much needed second pair of eyes to
help solve problems.

AI Software Discovery
Develop AI based services for Software Discovery in SRCNet.
1 Use AI agents to scan all of the existing software registered in the CADC
CANFAR software repository and extract as much descriptive text as possible
2 Configure a LLM to injest the text and provide a natural language search
engine for Software Discovery.
3 Develope a Web service API to make the injector and search functionality
available as services in SRCNet.
