Execution Broker review

The Execution Broker project has evolved into several components covering
multiple streams within SRCNet, not only Execution Broker itself, but
the work on the data model applies to Workstep Execution, Workstep
Editing, Software Discovery, Science Portal, data provenance, and user
history.
The goal of this feature is to bring more people on board to share the
knowledge about the project and help handle some of the tasks.

The feature deliverable would be to produce a review of the project,
including a technical analysis of the work done so
far, and an assesment of the potential benefits, problems and issues
going forward.

The work would probably take around two weeks of work for two people
(the reviewer and the reviewee) spread
over two months. It would include a series of meetings with space in
between to create the documentation needed to fill in the gaps.

The result is that  SRCNet will have at least one other person who understands
all the different aspects of the project. Increasing the bus number to more
than one.

The new members of the team be able to guide the next phases of development
and provide much needed help to solve technical problems.

AI Software Discovery
Develop AI based services for Software Discovery in SRCNet.
1 Use AI agents to scan all of the existing software registered in the CADC
CANFAR software repository and extract as much descriptive text as possible
2 Configure a LLM to injest the text and provide a natural language search
engine for Software Discovery.
3 Develope a Web service API to make the injector and search functionality
available as services in SRCNet.
