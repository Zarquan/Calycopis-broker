    ?   following the pattern of
    ?   PrepareComponentRequestEntity
    ?   which calls the
    ?   getPrepareAction()
    ?   on
    ?   LifecycleComponent
    ?   
    ?   can you create
    ?   MonitorComponentRequestEntity
    ?   which calls
    ?   getMonitorAction()
    ?   on
    ?   LifecycleComponent
    ?   
    ?   can you add an implementation of
    ?   getMonitorAction()
    ?   to
    ?   DockerSimpleComputeResourceEntity
    ?   that polls the status of the running container
    ?   and updates
    ?   the phase of the execution session
    ?   with the corresponding value, RUNNING, COMPLETED, or FAILED.


    ?   Can you add new functionality to the DockerContainerEntity
    ?   estimatePrepareTime() method
    ?   to check to see if the requested container image
    ?   is already available in the local Docker service.
    ?   If the image is already available, and the checksum is correct,
    ?   then adjust the estimated prepare time to take this
    ?   into account.







    ?   Extend pause container to add an optional error code.
    ?   Use this to test transition to FAILED status.


    ?   Curl container that returns JSON for HEAD and GET




MonitorComponentRequestEntity




    ?   Based on what we have done in this session can you suggest any changes to the AGENTS.md file that would make implementing tasks like this easier in the future.
