    Where next.
    Sending a request creates a set of offers.
    The set has an expiry time, inherited by the offers.

    Updating to ACCEPTED or CANCELLED on an offer nulls the expiry time.
 ** TODO accepting one offer updates the rest to rejected and nulls the expiry time.
    TODO reject the whole set - implies state on the offerset.
    TODO also suggests there is an aggregate state on the offerset.
    - EXPIRED if all of them are expired
    - REJECTED if all of them are rejected
    - ACCEPTED if ONE of them is accepted

    cron update endpoint
    Updates the Execution state to the next level.

    Booking time slots, based on duration.
    Maintain a count of how many in each time slot.
    Do we continue with HashMaps, or do we start to use a database ?

    bestinDay => a timeslot offer
        + schedule start time
        + compute resources

    bestinWeek => a timeslot offer
        + schedule start time
        + compute resources

    a database just for the schedule might be the way to go for now

    timeslots are the unknown unknown
    extend create to calculate the best offers based on timeslots
    placeholder for the execution
