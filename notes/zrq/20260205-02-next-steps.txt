        Finish the automated build.
        1) GitHub action to build Python OpenAPI client.
            - where do we add extra layer
            - where do we publish it to (PyPi) ?

        2) GitHub action to build Java OpenAPI client.
            - where do we add extra layer

        3) GitHub action to build our Java broker
            - needs TestPlatform to be able to test it

        4) GitHub action to build our Docker image


        Add Python and Java tests.
            Based on the examples, point at a service and check the results make sense.

    Broker

        Create GitHub issue about splitting the API
            Reasons why this isn't a good idea
                One service would be input only
                One service would be output only
                Developing/testing one without the other would mean poking the database.
                What about the component endpoints ?

        Create GitHub issue for creating a download webapp.
            Claude ?
                Start with an OpenAPI schema and ask an agent to build it for me.

        Start the discussion about references ?
        Need to document the model first.

            Why is this a good idea ?
            Flattens the serialization of the model.
            Follows pattern established by Kubernetes.
            + Makes editor services easier to implement.

            - Means we need to create a client ontop of the OpenAPI client.
            - Means the server side classes are not covered by the model.
              ... politics are good on this

        Document the model.
        Sequence diagrams and class hierarchy.

        Create Platform implementations

            Test platform
                Add params that control the response
                Deliberate error conditions etc.

            Kube platform
                Integrates with kubectl API to run a container
                Run it on DigitalOcean K8 to get on with it
                Needs authentication

            Docker platform
                Sounds easy, but depends on how your Docker is setup.
                Run it on a DigitalOcean VM to get on with it
                Needs authentication

        User authentication
            Google
            SRCNet IAM
            UK IAM


    SRCNet
        metadata
            workstep - probably a lost cause.
