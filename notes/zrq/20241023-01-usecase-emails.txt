Hiya,

We met at the SKA SRCNet meeting in Sweden where I made a presentation about
the work we are doing to develop the IVOA ExecutionBroker service.
If my notes are right, I think you raised question at the meeting about how
it would support parallel processing using tools like Dask.

We are working on collecting a set of science based use cases for interacting
with the science platform that will form a set of requirements for the next
phase of software development.

Would you be interested in answering a few questions to help us understand how
you would want to use the SKA science platform to perform data analysis?

We are specifically interested in hearing from people pushing the boundaries
of different analysis tools and technologies, beyond just simple notebooks
and batch jobs. learning about how they see the field evolving, and where
they think we will need to be in 5 or 10 years time.

Thanks,
-- Dave

Hi James,

We met at the IVOA conference at Macquarie in May this year.

At the end of the conference you invited me to a meeting with yourself
and some of your colleagues to talk about how the IVOA ExecutionBroker
could enable researchers to execute parts of your data processing pipeline.

I'm in the process of collecting a set of science use cases for the
ExecutionBroker to guide the next stages of development and I'd like
to follow up on the use case you were describing.

Are you still interested in using something like the IVOA ExecutionBroker
to provide access to parts of your data processing pipeline ?

Cheers,
-- Dave

Hi Emmanuel,

We met a few weeks ago in the office at Manchester, and you were kind enough
to describe some of the work that you are doing, and pointed me at this fascinating
research paper.

I'm in the process of collecting a set of science use cases for the
a component in the SKA science platform and I'd be interested in
seeing if we could use parts of this example as a basis for
a use case document that describes a similar workflow
using SKA or e-MERLIN data.

Would you be willing to help by answering some real novice questions
about what this kind of workflow might involve.

Regards,
-- Dave

Hi Julia,

We talked briefly about some science use cases for SKA when I was in the
office at Manchester a few weeks ago

I'm looking for some help in developing an example use case that we can
use to demonstrate the software we are developing that will form part of
the SKA science platform.

In the first case I'm looking for a fairly simple workflow we can use,
something along the lines of selecting a specific piece of data, possibly
from the e-Merlin public data set, applying a data processing step and
then displaying the result.

Something really simple to start with, but something that we can evolve
into a more complex more realistic science workflow as we add more
capabilities to the software.

Would you be willing to help by answering some real novice questions
about what this kind of workflow might involve ?

Regards,
-- Dave
