YES to all of this.
Yes, I have concerns about privacy and ethics, but not adopting it is not an option.

I have more privacy concerns about using the Microsoft integrated solution that the University have negotiated than using agentic systems themselves.
If I configure and run the agents myself, I can control what they see.

Cost wise I am paying around £100 per month for subscriptions to OpenAI (£20), Claude (£20), and Cursor (£60).

The new skills we need to learn are how to analyse a complex architecture and guide the agentic system.

Given the current squeeze on funding, pivoting our team towards designing services that compatible with AI agents will put us at an advantage.

Starting with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) might be the way to go.

Some of the people in SRCNet are already heading in this direction.
