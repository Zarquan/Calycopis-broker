#
# Lists all the "obscore" services (suprisingly short list).
# Filter by 'startswith' 'GAVO'.
# Filter by 'startswith' 'CADC'.

query the obscore service for interesting data.
get the obs_publisher_did

resolve the first part in the registry
check for a datalink capability

use the datalink service to get the access url(s)

I know that would fail for the CADC case because their DataLink servivce isn't registered.
