        For SDC1, we have fits images, available here
        https://www.skao.int/en/464/ska-science-data-challenge-1 [skao.int]

        For SDC2, fits cubes of various size, available here
        https://sdc2.skao.int/sdc2-challenge/data [sdc2.skao.int]

        For SDC3, visibilities stored as both measurement sets and UVFITS, plus FITS data cubes. The cubes are here
        https://sdc3.skao.int/challenges/foregrounds/data [sdc3.skao.int]

        But the for the visibilities we have a more ad-hoc procedure, because of their size (7.5 TB for each MS or UVFITS).
        If you are interested, we can give you access to download from our servers.
