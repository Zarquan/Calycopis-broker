    Ideas for IVOA presentations

    OpenAPI - it works !

        Review of last year's poster
        Solved the problem with $ref links by creating pre-processor
        Work in progress to split EB schema into re-usable building blocks

    OpenAPI - it works !

        Code generation is easy.
        Writing OpenAPI is easy - nice clean syntax, low barrier to entry

        Skaha client - writing Java client would be difficult
        writing OpenAPI was easy, generating client was easy
        Working Java client for Skaha in < 1/2 day.

    Execution broker

        Discussion of interactive/non-interactive
        SRCNet are making the distinction, because historical, not technical.
        EB can handle both equally well.
        Link to the wiki page

        If it doesn't fit your use case, propose changes ?

        Call for people willing to review the work so far
        and look at where to go next.

    Purls

    Permanent URLs

    Underneath, a simple redirect.

    http://{permanent-address}/something/thing}
    HTTP redirect to
    http://{transient-address}/{something/thing}

    Use case
    OpenAPI schema
    ...

    XML schema
    ...

    Means we are not tied to commercial provider - GitHub
    We can move our code to another repository, and update the redirect.

    Options
    The original Purl.org
    Works, but is a bit flakey, and has had funding issues.


    https://w3id.org/
    Permanent Identifiers for the Web

    Fork the git repo and add IVOA directory
    https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org


    Or we roll our own
    http://purl.ivoa.net/

    We already have the technology to support it.
    Just needs a web server with redirect support.
    Go for it to see how it works.
