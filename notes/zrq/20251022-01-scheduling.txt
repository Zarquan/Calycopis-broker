    Target:

        Refactor the scheduling

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    At the moment we use the IvoaBeans to create our Entities.
    Including creating the ScheduledComponentEntity from an IvoaComponentSchedule.
    Problem is that the IvoaComponentSchedule has String values that we have to parse,
    and the IvoaComponentSchedule comes from the remplate, so it doesn't have the
    individual schedule for this instance.

    The Validator.Result will have getPreparationTime() and getTotalPreparationTime() for each resource.

    So can we pass the Result into the Builder ?

    At the moment it is the other way around.
    The Result contains a Builder.
    and the Result implements getPreparationTime
    so really, we want to move getPreparationTime into the Builder
    so that is can use the prepare time to build the entity
