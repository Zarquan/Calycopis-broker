        Resource usage and prov

            The IVOA provenance model is not rich enough to satisfy our eMERLIN use cases
            (especially as an SRCNet precursor) and while I’m sure there are metadata models
            for resource usage, I’m not sure where to start aside from your work with
            Execution Broker type situations.

            Thus, I’m wondering if you know of re-usable data models for either of these
            spheres that are in use somewhere (or has work already begun by SRCNet on
            Exec. Broker resource metadata) so that we can recycle work or make for more
            interoperability?

        ADASS 2024

            Please note that the proceedings submission deadline has been extended to Friday 17th January.
            Write up experiences with using OpenAPI to define web services.

            I am attending ADASS virtually due to work commitments,
            but I would be more than happy to meet with you online :)

            My expertise lies in CUDA programming using GPUs, though I am less familiar with hardware selection.
            While I am not sure how much assistance I can provide in the area that you mentioned,
            I'd be glad to meet if you think it would be helpful.

        Chris Skipper <chris.skipper@manchester.ac.uk>

            Yes, I think GPU compute capability is an essential parameter for requesting GPU resources.
            If a user is writing GPU-enabled code in a python-type language then a lot of the implementation
            is hidden from the programmer, and python will likely use whatever resources are available.
            But if the code was written in CUDA, then it would have very strict requirements on the minimum
            compute capability that could be used. e.g. if CUDA's atomicAdd() function has been used on 64-bit
            floats then it will only work with compute capability 6.0 and over.

    IVOA Product type
    https://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type/2024-05-19/product-type.html

        This vocabulary gives a high level classification for data products in
        astronomy. It is derived from a word list used by obscore to facilitate
        by-product type discovery (“find spectra”) and is intended to cover
        similar use cases elsewhere (e.g., “find services serving spectra” in
        Registry). A related use case this is supposed to cover is “route data
        products to applications that can handle them,” in particular in
        Datalink content_qualifier.
