    Target:

        Thinking about how the editor interface would work.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Editing API ..

    Iterative editing, works like faceted search.

    The editing API *is* the offers API.
    Each step in creating the workflow submits it be evaliated.

    First step is to post the initial workflow to the service.

    If the workflow is incomplete, workflow execution returns NO, with the workflow, and some ERROR messages.
    If the workflow is complete, workflow execution submits it to the execution brokers to get their responses.
    Returns YES/NO, with the annotated workflow (NO), or the offers (YES).
    The user/client uses the available update methods to edit the workflow in the workflow execution service ?

    This represents a change from the current API.
    Is this next iteration - update API to include interactive editing ?

    This breaks the simple POST request/reaponse API because the same endpoint
    returns different things depending on whether the execution brokers responded YES/NO.

    Also, it might not be clear whether the request was regected because it was invalid,
    or because the target platform doesn't have capacity.

    Nope - we keep editing and submitting separate.
