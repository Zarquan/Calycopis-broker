        # Works, with a few quirks.
        # 99% of the time is spent in the Thread.sleep() inside TestProcessorEntity.process()
        # TestProcessorEntity.process() puts the task back on the queue with an activation time 30seconds in the future.
        # The processing loop will favor tasks that have already been claimed by this Thread.
        # So the system averages out to have ~5 tasks being processed and the rest waiting unclaimed in the queue.
        #
        # This is good enough for now.
        # Main thing is it doesn't get swamped by an overload of requests.
        #
        # TODO Migrate to an external PostgreSQL database to see how it performs.
        # TODO Experiment with more than one instance sharing the same database.
        #
        # When there is nothing in the queue it wastes a lot of time polling.
        # TODO Back off the polling loop when there isn't anything in the queue.
        # This will become a problem when we have several queue processors.
        #
        # More of a problem is the cleanup of the temp table in the booking query.
        # This slows the database down a lot and means requests take a long time to process.
        # TODO Tweak the booking query to be more performant.
