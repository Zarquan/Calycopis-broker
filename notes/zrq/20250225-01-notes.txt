OLD
https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5222

    BH: By implementing this sevice, best location for execution will be found, best use of the computing resources is obtained and information of the SRCNet computing resources in realtime will be provided
    Acceptance criteria:

    AC1: A global Service provided required functionality

    AC2: At least 2 execution broker running at 2 SRCNet nodes

    AC3: At least 1 one translation implementation of the execution broker interface to a relevant workflow handler

    AC4: Demo to the ART

NEW
Evolve Execution Broker Prototype to be compatible with first Workflow Execution Service
https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5222

    I think realistically it would be better to create a new one in Python.
    The Java prototype is not ready for deploying in production, and the main development expertise in SRCnet is in Python.
    There are SRCNet Python libraries for service authentication, token delegation etc that would be expensive to create in Java.
    So it would be better to use the Java prototype as a guide, copy many of the classes, and create a new Python implementation.

Implement a workflow execution service
https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5237
Implement an aggregator service which processes part of the request before passing it on.
Acting as a proxy, so it re-writes the URLs in the responses.
