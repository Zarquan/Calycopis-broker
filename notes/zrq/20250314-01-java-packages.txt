    Target:

        Refactor rhe Java packages.
        https://github.com/ivoa/Calycopis-broker/issues/179

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Refactor the Java packages to match the structure of the data model.
    At the moment we have a lot of top level packages.

        ls -1 java/spring/spring-webapp/src/main/java/net/ivoa/calycopis/

            builder
            component
            compute
            data
            executable
            execution
            factory
            message
            offers
            offerset
            platfom
            storage
            util
            validator
            webapp

    Of which, executable, data, compute and storage are elements of the data model.
    Mixed in with builder, validator, factory and webapp, which are functional parts of the code.
