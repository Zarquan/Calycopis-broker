        Changes to the data model and sequence diagram for SoftwareDiscovery.

        Extend Software Discovery API to support Execution Broker and Workflow Execution Services
        https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5279

            The current software discovery API returns a list of location of container images in response
            to a search query.
            In order to support the workflow execution service and execution broker, the software discovery
            should return the metadata required for the respective services to complete an end-to-end
            execution workflow

        Work in progress ...

    Changes requested by Calycopis

        Split the discovery metadata into blocks in a combined ExecutionDiscovery model:

            execution:
              # ExecutonBroker data model.
              executable:
                ....
              resources:
                compute:
                  ....
                storage:
                  ....
                data:
                  ....

            discovery:
              # SoftwareDiscovery data model
              ....

        Be aware that ExecutionBroker, WorkflowExecution and SceinePortal
        will all use the same data model.
        It does not make sense for SoftwareDiscovery to unilaterally define their
        own almost_but_not_quite_the_same data model.
        In means the other componments have to do extra work to compensate
        for the differences in the models.
        Interoperability between the layers is a key priority.


        Create importable schema element for SoftwareDiscovery
        https://github.com/ivoa/Calycopis-broker/issues/195

            Create an element in the ExecutionBroker schema that can be
            imported into the SoftwareDiscovery data model.

            Work in progress ...

        Import execution part from the ExecutionBroker schema


        Publish the SoftwareDiscovery code repository.


        Publish the SoftwareDiscovery data model.


        How much of the SoftwareDiscovery metadata structure is generated from the schema ?
