        1. ScienceGateway calls SoftwareDiscovery to get metadata about the executable.
        1. SoftwareDiscovery returns initial template for execution request.
        1. ScienceGateway uses the metadata to prompt user to select data inputs.
        1. ScienceGateway uses the metadata to fill in the defaults for compute resources.
        1. ScienceGateway advanced tab allows the user to edi the compute resources.
        1. ScienceGateway sends to completed execution request to WorkflowExecution.
