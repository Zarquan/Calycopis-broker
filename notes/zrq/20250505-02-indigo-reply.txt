    Dave:
    Have your team any experience of using or developing a faceted search platform ?

    Abhishek:
    We’ve implemented some search functionality using around 3–4 attributes, but I’m not sure we’ve handled more complex or dynamic attributes.
    However, if you’re planning to introduce a "faceted search" in the Software Discovery Service, we’d be happy to start a discussion regarding the same.
    We could also create a feature for that in the PI backlog.

    Dave:
    Hi Abhishek,
    I'm thnking about how to describe what we need for the discovery part of software discovery.
    If you had already worked on a faceted search platform it would make it easier to describe what is needed.
    Have your team any experience of using the Drupal content management system ?
