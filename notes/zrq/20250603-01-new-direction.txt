    Hey - I'd like us to discuss Dave's deployment for PI27. We can have a call if needed. I can see several opportunities, noting the conditions of the restructure:

    Continued development effort in the Coral+ team.
    Efforts would be limited to the "Science Enabling" and "Operations Enabling and Interoperability" products.

    "Distributed Data Computing" (and OEI) in the Chocolate+ team.
    This will be the home of federated / planned execution service development.
    Prioritisation and implementation decisions will ultimately be Rohini's, as PO, with the empowerment to direct the team cross-SRCs (subject to the Architect's + Technical Group's guardrails).

    Feature Owner responsibilities - which are not restricted to teams.

    Consultations with the Architect, PO(s), SRCNet Technical Group... (I'm not proposing STG membership given the already long list, but those decisions are with Jesus).

    Note that DevOps members are expected to belong to one team with 0.5+ FTE on SRCNet features only.
    With implementation being a focus area for the SRCNet team moving forwards, further development of the IVOA standard would be outside of SRCNet time.
    As with all the deployments - these decisions aren't forever - we will have the opportunity to make changes every PI from now on.

    ** further development of the IVOA standard would be outside of SRCNet time **

    Phone call with Robert Perry

    Not able to join Chocolate because politics.

    If I join Coral I will be restricted to "science enabling" only.

    SRCNet way is rapid experiments and throw away
    IVOA way is big complex getting it right first time
    Not true, but never mind.

    Work with Rohini and others to create a "technically agnostic" road map.
    - WTF does that mean ?

    Try not to get bogged down in technical details this iteration.

    Indigo will join Chocolate.
    Software Discovery is considered "science enabling" (no, it isn't).

    Hello again all - and apologies for the fragmented messages.
    For @Susana SÃ¡nchez @Laura Darriba's awareness - we are not expecting INSRC members to join Coral++ this PI.
    Similarly, I am not expecting CANSRC members to join Chocolate++ this PI.
    All of the former Red development effort should be split between Coral++ and the Metadata Management team.

    Regarding Dave - I believe we now have an outcome for the PI27 team picture.
    Thank you for our call today Dave.
    Apologies if I miss / repeat anything - this Slack is to also update the PT

Robert Perry

    This PI:
    Dave will not be joining the OEI+DDC (Chocolate++) team as a member

    Dave will continue as a SE+OEI (Coral++) team member
    Dave's FTE level is to be determined - likely as a function of the feature plan

    Both teams are empowered to work on OEI
    Dave may continue collaborating with INSRC members on features, for example

    Software Discovery is currently categorised as Science Enabling product - we have not moved this to MM
    so there is a further opportunity for feature work
    further backlog refinement may be be necessary - but Dave and the team should prioritise planning already agreed Program Backlog items
    We are all agreed that DDC discussions will continue - with a priority this PI clarifying the roadmap ahead, translating requirements from one level to another, and aligning the architectural roadmap.

Robert Perry

    Specifically, we'd like to see people in this space review each others' "look ahead" artefacts.
    This could be via the Architectural Review. In the meantime, I trust that activities can be shared /organised - like Feature Ownership, and topics/dates for technical discussions.
    Thank you all for your patience as we progress with the team restructuring.

# -----------------------------------------------------

    In planning

    SoftwareExecution has been assigned to Indigo in Chocolate.
    WorkflowExecution has been assigned to Indigo in Chocolate

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Too late to propose new features.
    I have to choose from backlog items already assigned to "Science Enabling"

    [SP-5550] Enabling submission of batch jobs to Slurm cluster from CANFAR at sweSRC
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5550

    [SP-5551] Enabling GPU-based workflows in CANFAR at sweSRC
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5551

    [SP-4993] Scalability Assessment of the prepareData Mount Approach
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-4993

    Reduced to picking up the crumbs.
    Throwing away the last 12mths work.

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Final plan - involved in three tasks

    [SP-5555] Deploy a new CANFAR registry within the SRCNet
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5555

    [SP-5550] Enabling submission of batch jobs to Slurm cluster from CANFAR at sweSRC
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5550

    [SP-5551] Enabling GPU-based workflows in CANFAR at sweSRC
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5551

    5 days updating EB data model
    5 days updating document

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Chocolate are going back to the start.

    [SP-5579] Implement job submission and job polling endpoints of the distributed data computing global service
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5579

    We will need to define and implement SRC-owned compute APIs independent of a specific WMS implementation and IVOA standards.

    This feature would build a python implementation of a global service using the current API structure based on the PanDA
    workload management system and implement two basic endpoints - job submission and job polling.

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Jesus - tech coordination group will define Execution API this iteration.
