    GitHub - strands-agents/agent-sop: Natural language workflows that enable AI agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks with consistency and reliability.
    https://github.com/strands-agents/agent-sop

        Agent SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are markdown-based instruction sets that guide
        AI agents through sophisticated workflows using natural language, parameterized inputs,
        and constraint-based execution.
        They transform complex processes into reusable, shareable workflows that work across
        different AI systems and teams.

    >   # Repository Guidelines
    >   
    >   - Repo: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
    >   - GitHub issues/comments/PR comments: use literal multiline strings or `-F - <<'EOF'` (or $'...') for real newlines; never embed "\\n".
    >   
    >   ## Project Structure & Module Organization
    >   
    >   - Source code: `src/` (CLI wiring in `src/cli`, commands in `src/commands`, web provider in `src/provider-web.ts`, infra in `src/infra`, media pipeline in `src/media`).
    >   - Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.
    >   - Docs: `docs/` (images, queue, Pi config). Built output lives in `dist/`.
    >   - Plugins/extensions: live under `extensions/*` (workspace packages). Keep plugin-only deps in the extension `package.json`; do not add them to the root `package.json` unless core uses them.
    >   - Plugins: install runs `npm install --omit=dev` in plugin dir; runtime deps must live in `dependencies`. Avoid `workspace:*` in `dependencies` (npm install breaks); put `openclaw` in `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` instead (runtime resolves `openclaw/plugin-sdk` via jiti alias).
    >   - Installers served from `https://openclaw.ai/*`: live in the sibling repo `../openclaw.ai` (`public/install.sh`, `public/install-cli.sh`, `public/install.ps1`).
    >   - Messaging channels: always consider **all** built-in + extension channels when refactoring shared logic (routing, allowlists, pairing, command gating, onboarding, docs).
    >     - Core channel docs: `docs/channels/`
    >     - Core channel code: `src/telegram`, `src/discord`, `src/slack`, `src/signal`, `src/imessage`, `src/web` (WhatsApp web), `src/channels`, `src/routing`
    >     - Extensions (channel plugins): `extensions/*` (e.g. `extensions/msteams`, `extensions/matrix`, `extensions/zalo`, `extensions/zalouser`, `extensions/voice-call`)
    >   - When adding channels/extensions/apps/docs, update `.github/labeler.yml` and create matching GitHub labels (use existing channel/extension label colors).
    >   
    >   ## Docs Linking (Mintlify)
    >   
    >   - Docs are hosted on Mintlify (docs.openclaw.ai).
    >   - Internal doc links in `docs/**/*.md`: root-relative, no `.md`/`.mdx` (example: `[Config](/configuration)`).
    >   - When working with documentation, read the mintlify skill.
    >   - Section cross-references: use anchors on root-relative paths (example: `[Hooks](/configuration#hooks)`).
    >   - Doc headings and anchors: avoid em dashes and apostrophes in headings because they break Mintlify anchor links.
    >   - When Peter asks for links, reply with full `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URLs (not root-relative).
    >   - When you touch docs, end the reply with the `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URLs you referenced.
    >   - README (GitHub): keep absolute docs URLs (`https://docs.openclaw.ai/...`) so links work on GitHub.
    >   - Docs content must be generic: no personal device names/hostnames/paths; use placeholders like `user@gateway-host` and “gateway host”.
