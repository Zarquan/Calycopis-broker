    Things we could ask Cursor to do.

    Fix a specific issue in the server side code.

        Refactor validate() to return void · Issue #340 · ivoa/Calycopis-broker
        https://github.com/ivoa/Calycopis-broker/issues/340

    Two step validation

        DataResource refers the the StorageResource it is stored on by uuid.
        StorageResource refers to the DataResources it stores by uuid.
        VolumeMount refers to DataResource
        There is the potential for loops in the references preventing the schema from loading.
        It depends which ones are processed first, storage, data or volumes.
        Solution is to split the validation into two steps
        * locate() - locate all of the objects, creating placeholdres for them
        * validate() - validate the located objects, including linking their references

    Session execution

        This is the missing part.
        Work on the Platforms, heading towards different types of platforms
        * TestPlatform
        * KubePlatform
        * DockerPlatform


    Session scheduling

        In the API we have simple and scheduled sessions.
        In the JPA entities we only have simple session, which includes scheduling information.
        In the API scheduled session extends simple session
        Is there a specific reason to separate them - give that the schedult is optional.

        Revisit AbstractExecutionSession, SimpleExecutionSession and ScheduledExecutionSession · Issue #46 · ivoa/Calycopis-schema
        https://github.com/ivoa/Calycopis-schema/issues/46
            Remove ScheduledExecutionSession, put everything in SimpleExecutionSession

        Better to move towards the open ended scheduling.
        Prepare has a start time, no end time.
        It will take at least <this long> to prepare the data.
        Then a batch mode platform will put it in the queue to be executed.
        Needs thinking about this one.
