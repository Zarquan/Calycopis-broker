    Single compute

    Split volumes
        instance-volume
        container-volume

    Split volumes
        data and storage ?

    Volumes part of compute
        Contained is logical
        Separate is very K8S
        Separate allows more complex mounting

    Science data
        Contains data

    A science resource is just a type of data resource.
    No need for the 'science' block.

    Structure for container.network.access
    Rather than 'true', create a URL if protocol is recognised.
    Add a type field ?

    Remove the 'resources' step.
    Everything is at the same level.

        executable:
          type: ..
          name: ..
          uuid: ..
          href: ..
        computer:
          type: ..
          name: ..
          uuid: ..
          href: ..
        volumes:
          - type: ..
            name: ..
            uuid: ..
            href: ..
          - type: ..
            name: ..
            uuid: ..
            href: ..
        storage:
          - type: ..
            name: ..
            uuid: ..
            href: ..
          - type: ..
            name: ..
            uuid: ..
            href: ..
        data:
          - type: ..
            name: ..
            uuid: ..
            href: ..
          - type: ..
            name: ..
            uuid: ..
            href: ..

        A container executable can contain installed executables.
        A container computer can contain computer nodes.

        A container volume contains data resources.
        A container volume contains storage resources.

        A storage resource contains data resources.
        A science resource contains data resources.


# -----------------------------------------------------
#

    Default pool for storage

    Fix storage references

    Fix container network

    Process uuids in inputs

    Everything editable
        endpoints
        hrefs

# -----------------------------------------------------
#

    SRCNet names services not interfaces.
    ExecutionBroker is the interface
    XyzBrokers are the services.

    PlatformBroker

        DockerBroker

        LibvirtBroker

        CanfarBroker

        OpenstackBroker

    WorkflowExecution - probably can't get this changed :-(
    WorkflowBroker

        Editable requests
        POST to the request endpoint
            phase = EDITING

        POST to the request endpoint
            phase = SENDING

    Split volumes
        instance-volume
        container-volume

        instance-volume pointing to data-resource
            => mounted as a file
        instance-volume pointing to storage-resource
            => mounted as a directory

        container-volume pointing to data-resource
            => mounted as a file in a directory
        container-volume pointing to storage-resource
            => mounted as a sub-directory

        container-volume creates a directory in the filesystem
        and then mounts the resources inside that

    Add science resources to the mix.

        science-instance-resource
        equivalent to a file

        instance-volume pointing to science-instance
            pointing to a single data-resource
            => science-instance name mapped to
                => data-resource mounted as a file

        instance-volume pointing to science-container
            containing a data-resource
            => science-instance name mapped to directory
               containing
                => data-resource(s) mounted as files
