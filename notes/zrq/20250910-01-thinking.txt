    Target:

        Just thinking.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Question about where to put the OpenAPI schema.

    Technically, the common parts are the components
    and the REST endpoints are the broker specific parts.

    On the other hand, if we want to demonstrate the common data
    model for SRCNet, splitting things up could loose momentum.

    Demonstrating the cross links to Jesus was complicated
    and might have diluted the impact.

    Probably best to start with everything in the same place.

    Combine the broker schema and it's components, along
    with the tools to build the classes.

# -----------------------------------------------------

    TODO

    Build steps for the schema products.
    Including Python packages.
