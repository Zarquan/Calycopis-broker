It might help to separate the act of finding software and trying to execute it.
We can then see we have two separate things
1) A Software Discovery service for finding software based on user friendly terms that describe what it does, what type of data it can handle etc.
2) A data model for describing how to execute an instance of the software, with details of the executable, along with the compute, storage and data resources it needs.

Development of the Discovery data model should be based on a use cases analysis that looks at how users want to search for software.
For example the name of the software, the name of the author, citations from papers etc.

The output results from discovery service point to one or more instances of the execution step data model that describe how to run the executable.
