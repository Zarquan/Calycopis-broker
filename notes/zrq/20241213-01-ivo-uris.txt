    PI24 Demos

    Online demo recording
    Session Two - An E2E Flow of SRCNet (v0.1)
    https://confluence.skatelescope.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=300778145

        00:15:51
        00:21:51
        Demo showed a table of data objects from the ObsCore TAP service (or the DataLink service ?)
        The identifier in the rows was a full formed ivo data ID (authority was test).

            ivo://test.skao/~?sp351_soda:2023-11-02-22-08-30_LoTSS-DR2_P42Hetdex07_mosaic-blanked.fits


        00:21:51
        Demo showed how to move data to a specific STORM
        including duration for how long to keep the data there

            Transfer is handled as an asynchronous job.


        00:56:55
        Demo showed a Python library being used to access SKA data.

            [astroquery.srcnet.core]
            srcnet.get_data(namespace='testing', name='ngc2403.fits')


        00:59:24
        Manu's demo refers to DIDs, which are Rucio `<namespace>:<filename>` identifiers.

        01:04:48
        Manu's demo shows Rucio DIDs resolved into local paths.

            {
            UID: 101,
            dids:
                [
                    {
                    did: "wallaby:WALLABY_J103702-273359_Hydra_Kin_TR1_ModSurfDems.fits"
                    localPath: "https://spsrc14.iaa.csic.es:18027//disk/dev/deterministic/wallaby/1d/ea/WALLABY_J103702-273359_Hydra_Kin_TR1_ModSurfDems.fits"
                    ts: "2024-11-26T12:08:16"
                    },
                    ....
                ]
            }

    Looking through the source code to find where all this happens

    Looks like the only thing that handles `ivo://...` identifiers is the portal.

    src-ui-tannet
    https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/src/src-ui/ska-src-ui-gateway/

        This is the repository for the frontend SRC net aceess to resources
        (e.g. Data, computing resources, relative documentation).

    Checked out a copy and ran grep looking for `ivo` ..

        The portal code assumes a specific syntax in an `accessURL` to extract the Rucio `namespace` and `filename`.
        https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/src/src-ui/ska-src-ui-gateway/-/blob/main/src/search-catalog/search-results-table.tsx#L260-276

        The portal code does this more than once ...
        https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/src/src-ui/ska-src-ui-gateway/-/blob/main/src/search-catalog/search-results-table.tsx#L316-326

        The portal code makes the same assumption about the syntax of an iov:// ID value to extract the Rucio `namespace` and `filename`.
        https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/src/src-ui/ska-src-ui-gateway/-/blob/main/src/search-catalog/search-results-table.tsx#L361-391

        `obs_publisher_did` is used to identify the selected row
        https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/src/src-ui/ska-src-ui-gateway/-/blob/main/src/search-catalog/search-results-table.tsx#L772-780
