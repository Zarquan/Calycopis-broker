    Target:

        Uploading files into Rucio.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Upload files.
    Create replicas.

    Query Rucio to list the replicas.
    Query DM API to get the replicas.
    => format of replica IDs
    => design for SkaoDataResource in DataModel.
    => Python code to query the DM API
    => Java code to query the DM API

    Publish the data model components
        IvoaDataResource
        SkaoDataResource
        Single Computer, sibling of Executable
        Decide model structure
            Volumes
            Science - science metadata
            Access  - data access

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Validate an IvoaDataResource
    If skao resolve into SkaoDataResource
        fetch the replicas
        use the replicas in schedule()
    use accessUrl to treat it as a download
        use the accessUrl in schedule()
