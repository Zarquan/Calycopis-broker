description: Update AIMetrics block in file headers for all modified or created files
alwaysApply: true
---

Every file you create or modify must have an AIMetrics block in its file header comment.

- If a file already has an AIMetrics block, update it by adding a new entry to the array (do not remove existing entries).
- If a file has no AIMetrics block, add one.
- For new files created entirely by the agent, set contribution value to 100.
- For modified files, estimate the percentage of lines changed and use that as the contribution value.

The format for Java files (inside the `/* */` header comment) is:

```
 * AIMetrics: [
 *     {
 *     "name": "Cursor CLI",
 *     "version": "2026.02.13-41ac335",
 *     "model": "Claude 4.6 Opus (Thinking)",
 *     "contribution": {
 *       "value": <percentage>,
 *       "units": "%"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
```

Place the block after the `</meta:header>` tag and before the closing `*/`.

For files with no AIMetrics or AI contribution, the block should be:

```
 * AIMetrics: []
```
